# Machine Learning Assignments
CS453X @ Worcester Polytechnic Institute

- Assignment 1: linear algebraic operations and step-wise classification of smiling/not smiling for human faces
- Assignment 2: linear regression for predicting age based upon face images using one-hot analytical solution and gradient descent
- Assignment 3: softmax regression for digit classification on MNIST data with various data augmentation techniques
- Assignment 4: support vector machines for santander kaggle competition
- Assignment 5: principle component analysis on MNIST digit data

note: none of the assignments used any off-the-shelf models from any machine learning libraries, but rather were implemented from scratch
